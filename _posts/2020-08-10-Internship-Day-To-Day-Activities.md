# [IOV](https://iov.one/)

IOV provides a universal protocol for blockchains and wallet users.

IOV solves the problem of complexity, human error and lack of  interoperability when exchanging digital assets on the blockchain.

IOV provides the Blockchain Communication Protocol that enables  autonomous blockchains to be accessed efficiently. Additionally, IOV  provides the Blockchain Name Service, the first DNS for all  participating blockchains.

### What is a starname?

A starname is your universal username for the blockchain world.

It enables you to receive crypto-currencies or to log in to blockchain applications in a seamless way. Transferring value becomes fast and easy.

I am so proud to anounce that I am offered a part time internship here as software engineer Intern.



## Week 1 (10 August - 14 August)

I was introduced with the team i.e. [Antoine](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/antoine-herzog-65aa7257) the co-founder, [Dave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davepuchyr/) the CTO and [Iharob](https://github.com/iharob) the core developer. I was warmly welcomed by all, was provided access to the Repositories, joined their channel.

For the first two days Iharob was kind enough to navigate me through the application and gave me a brief intoduction of what they are planning to do in the nearby future.

I was provided with a simple task to convert incoming data from API to structured data. As first, I thought this was a easy task, but then came all sort of sub-tasks like creating types, typecasting data, dividing into methods to avoid duplicate code and variable names. Thanks to Iharob, I managed to complete these tasks.

I was provided with some material by Antoine to help we getting familiar with Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptography. I'm gonna spend my weekend learning about it.



## Week 2 (17 August - 21 August)

Yet to come.
